This is an early draft trying to bring a more modern look to the readthedocs
theme included in the asciidoctor gem. 

NOTE: At this point in time the only change compared to distributed version
      is that the fonts have been adjusted.

== How to use

=== Copy the css file
Simply copy the `readthedocs.css` file to your projects root folder and run
`asciidoctor` as follows:

[source,shell]
----
asciidoctor -a stylesdir="$(pwd)" -a sytlesheet=readthedocs.css *.adoc
----

=== As a git submodule 

Add the style as git submodule into your project.

[source,shell]
----
git submodule add \
  https://github.com/uroesch/asciidoctor-readthedocs-theme \
  readthedocs
----

The run asciidoctor as shown below.

[source,shell]
----
asciidoctor \
  -a stylesdir="$(pwd)/readthedocs" \
  -a sytlesheet=readthedocs.css \
  *.adoc
----

== Build from scratch

* docker

Simply type rake and the command will download a docker container for the
build. And create the `readthedocs.css` file.
