:sectanchors:

:url-docs: https://asciidoctor.org/docs
:url-gem: https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor

A brief reference of the most commonly used AsciiDoc syntax.
You can find the full documentation for the AsciiDoc syntax at {url-docs}.

== Paragraphs

A normal paragraph.
Line breaks are not preserved.
// line comments, which are lines that start with //, are skipped

A blank line separates paragraphs.

[%hardbreaks]
This paragraph carries the `hardbreaks` option.
Notice how line breaks are now preserved.

 An indented (literal) paragraph disables text formatting,
 preserves spaces and line breaks, and is displayed in a
 monospaced font.

[sidebar#id.role]
A style, ID, and/or role gives a paragraph (or block) special meaning, like this sidebar.

NOTE: An admonition paragraph, like this note, grabs the reader's attention.

== Text Formatting
:hardbreaks:

.Constrained (applied at word boundaries)
*strong importance* (aka bold)
_stress emphasis_ (aka italic)
`monospaced` (aka typewriter text)
"`double`" and '`single`' typographic quotes
+passthrough text+ (substitutions disabled)
`+literal text+` (monospaced with substitutions disabled)

.Unconstrained (applied anywhere)
**C**reate+**R**ead+**U**pdate+**D**elete
fan__freakin__tastic
``mono``culture

.Replacements
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
(C) 1976 Arty Artisan
I believe I shall--no, actually I won't.

.Macros
// where c=specialchars, q=quotes, a=attributes, r=replacements, m=macros, p=post_replacements, etc.
The European icon:flag[role=blue] is blue & contains pass:[************] arranged in a icon:circle-o[role=yellow].
The pass:c[->] operator is often referred to as the stabby lambda.
Since `pass:[++]` has strong priority in AsciiDoc, you can rewrite pass:c,a,r[C++ => C{pp}].
// activate stem support by adding `:stem:` to the document header
stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]

:!hardbreaks:
== Attributes

 // define attributes in the document header; must be flush with left margin
 :name: value

You can download and install Asciidoctor {asciidoctor-version} from {url-gem}.
C{pp} is not required, only Ruby.
Use a leading backslash to output a word enclosed in curly braces, like \{name}.

== Links

[%hardbreaks]
https://example.org/page[A webpage]
link:../path/to/file.txt[A local file]
xref:document.adoc[A sibling document]
mailto:hello@example.org[Email to say hello!]

== Anchors

[[idname,reference text]]
// or written using normal block attributes as `[#idname,reftext=reference text]`
A paragraph (or any block) with an anchor (aka ID) and reftext.

See <<idname>> or <<idname,optional text of internal link>>.

xref:document.adoc#idname[Jumps to anchor in another document].

This paragraph has a footnote.footnote:[This is the text of the footnote.]

== Lists

Supports block-level elements (paragraphs, delimited blocks, and block macros). 
This style effectively creates a nested, standalone AsciiDoc document. 
Implicit attributes such as doctitle from the parent document will be shadowed. 
Custom attributes are inherited.

Code sample `inside table cell`.
